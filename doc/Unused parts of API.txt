The following parts of the Button API (Windows 10) are not used:

Messages:
---------
- BM_SETDONTCLICK (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa970931.aspx)
	-> requires comctl32.dll 6.10 or newer, but may exist on older versions, too (because the name doesn't start with BCM_*)
	-> it's for radio buttons only
	-> the OptionButton control already works like BST_DONTCLICK being set
- BM_SETSTYLE (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms673571.aspx)
	-> there doesn't seem to be any real difference to the SetWindowLong() approach currently used

- BCN_HOTITEMCHANGE (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms673556.aspx)
	-> requires comctl32.dll 6.0 or newer
	-> doesn't have any benefit over the TrackMouseEvent() approach (can't even replace it entirely)
